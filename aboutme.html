							<p> I am passionate about whiteboards and dry erase markers, as a graduate student they both were my bread and butter. I graduated from Auburn University in 2020 with a Bachelor’s in Business Analytics, I followed that by a Master’s in Data Engineering from Auburn as well. <br />

							I perused Data Science because I am a self-starter, I am detailed orientated, I enjoy learning, and I like to simplify a problem as much as possible.  I love presenting my work, and I believe the better understanding of the problem I have, the better I will be able to present my findings at the end; and my professional experience throughout school allowed me to improve my presenting skills.  <br />

								Usually while working on a project not only, I immerse myself in the data, but I also like to conduct research about the field where data in from. For example, I spent weeks learning about used car market when I was working on the car pricing model. I spoke to multiple car dealers, and working analytics professionals, in my attempt to make the best model. <br />

								I worked on number of projects applying various ML techniques in both R and python environment using libraries such as matlibplt, seaborn, geoplotlib, sklearn, keras, pandas etc. Please check out my work in machine learning, NLP, and web design. <br/>
