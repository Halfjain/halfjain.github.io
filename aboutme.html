							<p> I am passionate about whiteboards and dry-erase markers, and as a graduate student, they both were my bread and butter. I graduated from Auburn University in 2020 with a Bachelor’s in Business Analytics, I followed that by a Master’s in Data Engineering from Auburn as well. <br /> <br/>

								My fascination with Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence began in 2017 when I saw the Netflix documentary, AlphaGo. At the time I was studying architecture in one of the top 5 schools in the US, but I ended up switching my major so I can build cool stuff like the people from the documentary. Since then, I have found my passion in answering questions through data mining. From fantasy football to building a model to predict used car values, while working on a project I immerse myself in the data. I am curious, my research usually goes beyond the traditional exploratory analysis, I often find myself in scholarly articles, sub-reedits, StackOverflow, medium.com, and YouTube videos researching my topic and learning from subject matter experts. <br /> <br/>

								Prior to transferring to Auburn, I was on a track & field team, which instilled strong team values in me. From early in my career, I have seen the success that can be achieved when everyone is working together to achieve the same goal. My work experience over years has not only made me a better team player, but also made me a proficient communicator, collaborator, and leader. I love presenting my work, and background knowledge of my topic and the experience from client-facing roles help me engage and understand my audience while presenting my findings.<br /> <br/>

								I worked on several projects applying ML techniques in both R and python environments using libraries such as matlibplt, seaborn, geoplotlib, sklearn, keras, pandas, etc. Please check out my work in machine learning, NLP, and web design.<br/> <br/>
